# How to use the script:
First you must have python 3.8 installed in your computer.

Follow the instructions on this link.

To run the program, you need to learn how to run a script from a command line (the black windows stuffs). In the future we will make it more user friendly.

In short :
1. Open the terminal line in the Randomizer folder. Here is a link that might help you : https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/
2. Type the command. To see the options, use -h : python main.py -h
--WINDOWS:python main.py -[FLAGS] --seed [SEED] --worldselect
--MAC : python3 main.py  -[FLAGS] --seed [SEED] --worldselect
---EXAMPLE : python main.py -eiwd --seed 342
3. Enjoy!
